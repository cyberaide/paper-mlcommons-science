\section{Benchmarks for the First Release}
\label{sec:benchmarks}

As outlined in Section~\ref{sec:science-wg}, the WG has consolidated four different benchmarks from four different branches of sciences, namely, {\tt cloud-mask}, {\tt stemdl}, {\tt candle-uno} and {\tt tevelop}. We describe each of these benchmarks in detail, covering the science case, objectives, metrics, data and outline the baseline reference implementation. The aim here is to ensure that the community is aware of these challenges, and can develop techniques outperforming the baseline cases.
